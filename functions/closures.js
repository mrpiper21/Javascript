// Closures
// An important topic in JavaScript is the concept of closures.
// When a function is created, it has access to a reference to all the 
// variables declared around it, also known as it's lexical environment. 
// The combination of the function and its enviroment is called a closure. 
// This is a powerful and often used feature of the language.

function createAdder(a) {
    function f(b) {
        const sum = a + b;
        return sum;
    }
    return f;
}
const f = createAdder(3);
console.log(f(4)); // 7
// In this example, createAdder passes the first parameter a and the inner 
// function has access to it. This way, createAdder serves as a factory of new
//  functions, with each returned function
